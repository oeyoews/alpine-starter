## Clone

Clone the repository (using `nuxi`):

npx nuxi init -t themes/alpine
```

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Edge Side Rendering

Can be deployed to Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, AWS, and most Node-compatible environments.

The HTML files will be generated in the .output/public directory and ready to be deployed to any static compatible hosting.
